## Response Text

Completed the implementation planning for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook with:

1. **Research Document**: Created comprehensive research.md covering all 4 phases with detailed implementation approaches for each component
2. **Data Model**: Defined core entities including Textbook Chapter, Exercise, CodeExample, UserProgress, ROS2Component, and SimulationModel
3. **Quickstart Guide**: Created detailed setup and development guide for contributors
4. **API Contracts**: Developed comprehensive API contracts for all interactive features
5. **Updated Plan**: Enhanced the implementation plan with detailed phases, constitution checks, and risk mitigation strategies

The plan now includes:
- Detailed implementation phases aligned with the user's specified timeline
- Enhanced constitution checks including ROS2 Integration, Safety Consciousness, and Assessment Quality
- Comprehensive project structure supporting the phased development approach
- Risk mitigation strategies for technical, content, and timeline risks
- API contracts for all interactive features (chapters, exercises, progress tracking, chatbot, etc.)

## Outcome

The implementation plan is now complete and ready for task generation. All specified phases have been detailed with specific objectives and approaches, ensuring the textbook will meet university-level academic standards while providing practical, hands-on experience with ROS2, simulation environments, and modern robotics concepts.

## Evaluation

The planning phase has successfully addressed all aspects of the user's requirements, with proper documentation and structure to support the 16-week curriculum development.
