# ADR 002: Content Structure and Organization for Physical AI Textbook

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to establish a consistent structure for a comprehensive Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook that will span 16 chapters. The structure must:
- Maintain consistency across all chapters
- Support educational objectives for university-level content
- Accommodate both theoretical and practical components
- Facilitate independent learning and assessment
- Enable modular development and updates

## Decision
We will structure each chapter with 7 standardized components:
1. **Learning Objectives** (3-5 specific, measurable points)
2. **Theoretical Foundations** with diagrams and visual aids
3. **Python/ROS2 Code Examples** with practical implementation
4. **Practical Exercises** for hands-on learning
5. **Chapter Summary** with key takeaways
6. **Further Reading** with academic and practical references
7. **Assessment Questions** for knowledge validation

Each chapter will be approximately 2000 words to maintain consistency in depth and student time investment.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Traditional textbook format**: Standard sections without specific component requirements
2. **Project-based structure**: Organized around projects rather than topics
3. **Modular approach**: Smaller, more granular sections that could be combined
4. **Problem-focused**: Each chapter centered on solving specific robotics problems

## Consequences
### Positive
- Standardized structure improves student learning experience and navigation
- Consistent format enables predictable study patterns
- Required practical components ensure hands-on learning
- Assessment questions provide immediate feedback mechanism
- 2000-word target provides sufficient depth while maintaining manageability
- Modular structure allows for updates to individual chapters without affecting others

### Negative
- Rigid structure may not suit all content types optimally
- Fixed word count might constrain complex topics or over-expand simpler ones
- Required components increase development effort per chapter
- May require adaptation for different learning styles
