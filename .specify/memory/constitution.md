# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Content must meet university-level academic standards with rigorous theoretical foundations, clear learning objectives, and evidence-based pedagogical approaches. Every section must include learning outcomes that are measurable and aligned with course objectives.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All code snippets, algorithms, and technical explanations must be accurate, up-to-date, and tested. Python/ROS2 implementations must follow best practices and be verifiable through simulation or real-world examples. Technical content must be reviewed by domain experts.

### III. Practical Application Focus (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every theoretical concept must be accompanied by practical examples, code implementations, and real-world applications in humanoid robotics. Content must bridge the gap between academic theory and engineering practice, with hands-on exercises and implementation challenges.

### IV. Modular Content Structure
Content must be organized in 2000-word sections that are self-contained yet interconnected. Each chapter must be independently learnable while contributing to the overall curriculum. Sections must support flexible course scheduling and topic selection.

### V. Interactive Learning Elements
Each chapter must include interactive exercises, programming challenges, and practical assignments that reinforce theoretical concepts. Content must engage students through hands-on activities and provide immediate feedback mechanisms.

### VI. Accessibility and Inclusivity
All content must be accessible to students with diverse backgrounds and abilities. Technical jargon must be clearly defined, concepts must be explained at multiple levels of complexity, and examples must represent diverse applications and use cases.

## Content Standards

All content must follow Docusaurus markdown structure with consistent formatting, proper cross-referencing, and integrated navigation. Chapters must include: learning objectives, theoretical foundations, practical examples, code snippets, exercises, and summaries. Visual elements must be properly captioned and support learning objectives.

## Technical Implementation

The textbook must be deployable to GitHub Pages with integrated RAG chatbot for enhanced learning support. ROS2 code examples must be compatible with standard distributions (Humble Hawksbill or later) and include simulation environments for practical exercises. All code must be well-documented with comments explaining robotics-specific concepts.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation, review, and approval processes for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All contributions must comply with these principles. Content changes require peer review by domain experts and validation through practical implementation. Versioning follows semantic versioning with major updates for curriculum changes, minor for content additions, and patches for corrections.
